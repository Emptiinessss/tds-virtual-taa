(3 min)](https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/8qkxeZmKmOY/sddefault.webp)](https://youtu.be/8qkxeZmKmOY)\n\nHere's how it works:\n\n- It takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n- ... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with `=` to make the length a multiple of 4)\n- There's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\n- Base64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\n\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\n\n```python\nimport base64\n\n# Basic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\n# Convert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode()  # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\n# Convert base64 back to text\ndecoded = bas",
